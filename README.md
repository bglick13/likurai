**Why líkurai?**

Líkurai is a combination of líkur (the Icelandic word for probability) and AI (the English word for AI)

**What is líkurai?**

This is the home for all the Probabilistic AI tools I have developed over the course of my various personal projects.

I'm attempting to make it an easy to use API so that people can quickly get up and running with some fun stuff like Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN).

**Okay but why Bayesian?**

Becuase the world is uncertain! Sure, traditional neural networks are great for certain tasks like playing Atari games or doing image classification, but even that gets tricky pretty quickly.


For example, how would an animal classifier do on the image below?

Is it a cat? No. Is it a dog? Also no. A traditional neural network will be forced to guess, and has no real way to express that fact.

Of course, a BNN won't get it "right" either, since "right" doesn't exist in this example. However, a BNN can be *more* right by expressing how wrong it thinks it is.

**Fine, but does it work?**

Yeah! What'd you expect me to say?

It's worked on a bunch of super secret personal projects. That's the whole point of me making this library.

I'm working on making some examples on traditional datasets (MNIST!) so you can have a real comparison, but until then, just take my word for it.
